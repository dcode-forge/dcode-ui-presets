## Installing the FrontEnd Preset
To include the Front End files run the following command:
```php artisan ui dcode-preset-ui``` 

This command will:
- overwrite existing auth blades,
- include admin layouts for user list and edit,
- add a kitchen sink layout presenting all the components we use,
- provide the sass settings to use the sass-lib package,
- and import the standard vue components used for our projects.
